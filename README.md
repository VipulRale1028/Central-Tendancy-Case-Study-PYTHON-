**Central tendency** refers to the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire data set using a single value that reflects the center of the data distribution.

The three main measures of central tendency are:

---

### 1. **Mean (Average)**

* **Definition**: The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
* **Formula**:

  $$
  \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x}{n}
  $$

  where $\sum x$ is the sum of all observations and $n$ is the number of observations.
* **Example**:
  Data = \[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
  Mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = **6**

---

### 2. **Median**

* **Definition**: The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending (or descending) order.
* **Steps**:

  * Arrange the data in order.
  * If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle value.
  * If even, the median is the average of the two middle values.
* **Example**:
  Data = \[3, 1, 4, 2, 5] → Sorted = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → Median = **3**

---

### 3. **Mode**

* **Definition**: The value(s) that occur most frequently in the data set.
* **Example**:
  Data = \[2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 4] → Mode = **4** (occurs 3 times)

| Measure | Description         | Best Used When                            |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Mean    | Arithmetic average  | Data is evenly distributed                |
| Median  | Middle value        | Data has outliers or is skewed            |
| Mode    | Most frequent value | Identifying most common category or score |
